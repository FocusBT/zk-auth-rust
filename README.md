# üîí ZK-Auth: High-Performance Zero-Knowledge Authentication

A highly optimized zero-knowledge proof-based authentication system built in Rust with Actix-Web. This system enables users to prove their identity without revealing sensitive personal information, using Groth16 zk-SNARKs and optimized Poseidon hash functions.

## ‚ö° Performance Highlights

- **Optimized Poseidon Hashing**: Pre-cached hashers eliminate initialization overhead
- **Pre-computed Verification Keys**: Faster proof verification using prepared keys  
- **Concurrent Proof Generation**: Semaphore-controlled parallel processing
- **Efficient Serialization**: Minimized memory allocations and field conversions
- **Fast Random Number Generation**: Optimized RNG for cryptographic operations

## üåü Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Prove identity without revealing personal data
- **High Performance**: Rust + Actix-Web with extensive optimizations
- **Groth16 Proofs**: Industry-standard zk-SNARK implementation
- **Cached Cryptography**: Pre-initialized Poseidon hashers and verification keys
- **Resource Management**: Smart concurrency control for optimal throughput
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Built-in performance testing tools

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Registration Service** (`/register`): Generates commitments from user data
2. **Proof Generation** (`/generate-proof`): Creates zero-knowledge proofs of identity  
3. **Verification Service** (`/verify-proof`): Validates proofs without revealing secrets
4. **ZK Circuit**: Circom-based circuit for proving knowledge of secrets

### System Flow

```
User Data ‚Üí Hash ‚Üí Secret ‚Üí Commitment ‚Üí ZK Proof ‚Üí Verification
```

1. User provides personal information (email, name, age, country, DOB)
2. System hashes this data using Keccak256 and optimized Poseidon
3. A secret is derived and a commitment is generated
4. User can later generate ZK proofs to authenticate without revealing the original data
5. Verifiers can validate these proofs using only the commitment

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.70+ with Cargo
- **Node.js**: 16+ with npm/pnpm (for benchmarking)
- **RAM**: 8GB+ (proof generation is memory-intensive)
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for concurrent proof generation

      "a": ["0x...", "0x..."],
      "b": [["0x...", "0x..."], ["0x...", "0x..."]],
      "c": ["0x...", "0x..."]
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true
}
```

## üìä Benchmarking

The project includes comprehensive benchmarking tools to measure performance under various load conditions.

### Node.js Benchmark

The main benchmark script (`bench-mark/bench.js`) provides detailed performance analysis:

```bash
# Ensure the server is running
cargo run --release &

# Run the benchmark
node bench-mark/bench.js
```

**Features:**
- Tests all three endpoints (`/register`, `/generate-proof`, `/verify-proof`)
- Multiple concurrency levels (1, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
- CPU and memory monitoring
- Latency percentiles and throughput metrics
- 15-second test duration per configuration

**Sample Output:**
```
====================== Benchmark results schema ======================

register  (concurrency 10)
  Avg latency  : 25.43 ms
  P50 latency  : 23.12 ms
  Throughput   : 2.45 MB/s
  Requests/sec : 387.23
  CPU (avg)    : 45.67 %
  Memory (avg) : 156.78 MB

generateProof  (concurrency 10)
  Avg latency  : 145.67 ms
  P50 latency  : 142.33 ms
  Throughput   : 1.23 MB/s
  Requests/sec : 67.89
  CPU (avg)    : 78.45 %
  Memory (avg) : 245.12 MB
```

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Zero-Knowledge Circuit

The core ZK circuit (`circuits/secret-proof.circom`) is elegantly simple:

```circom
template SecretProof() {
    signal input  secret;        // private
    signal input  commitment;    // public

    component h = Poseidon(1);
    h.inputs[0] <== secret;
    h.out === commitment;
}
```

This circuit proves knowledge of a `secret` such that `Poseidon(secret) = commitment` without revealing the secret.

### Cryptographic Components

1. **Keccak256**: Used for hashing user data (email, name)
2. **Poseidon**: ZK-friendly hash function for commitments and secrets
3. **BN254**: Elliptic curve for Groth16 proofs
4. **Groth16**: zk-SNARK proving system

### Scaling Considerations

- Proof generation is CPU-intensive and benefits from multiple cores
- Memory usage scales with concurrent proof generation
- Consider horizontal scaling for high-throughput deployments
- Pre-computed keys and cached hashers provide excellent single-node performance
